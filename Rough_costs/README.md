# Rough costs

A breakdown of the costs is provided in the [Rough_Costs PDF](./rough_costs.pdf) file.

>[!NOTE]
>**No labour costs (e.g. purchasing / soldering / construction / testing) are taken into account** - this work was undertaken on a hobby basis.

>[!TIP]
>If you have access to your own 3D printing capability then the cost of the cases will be limited to the cost of material. I use the facilities within my local Makerspace / Man Shed, so **my costs were minimal** and I could ensure the quality produced.

The cost of the cases provided is a rough figure from running the .STEP files through [Craftcloud 3D printing services](https://craftcloud3d.com/) and going with the cheapest option - I can't say what the quality of these will be!

All components were purchased for the best price available, taking account of any approaches to reducing / removing shipping costs (minimum order level, longer delivery times, etc.). The majority of the passive components, and a few of the active ones, were purchased from Aliexpress.

All prices are done on a pro-rata basis - e.g. 1-port RJ45 connectors are used in more than one item and therefore a bundle of 20x 1-port RJ45 connectors was purchased, however only a cost of 1/20th was allocated against the above costs (where an item required it). This could mean that there is spare stock for other items / projects.

Most purchases were done throughout 2023, so will probably have increased by now.

You will also need to provide power supplies / cables (Network / USB / HDMI) / etc. as required.
