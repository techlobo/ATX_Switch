#### Python scripts and modified PiKVM (kvmd) files required to enable operation of the ATX Switches from the PiKVM WebUI.

The files in this directory / sub-directories currently support WebUI ATX operations via the assigned GPIO pins.

Performing ATX operations via I2C has **not** yet been implemented.

Examples of the new scripts required for ATX Switch operation are provided in '[ATX python scripts](./ATX_python_scripts)', and will need configuring for the target environment as described in the installation guide.

Examples of the modified 'kvmd' scripts, together with requisite service files, are provided in '[Modified kvmd files](./Modified_kvmd_files)'.

The installation steps for configuring the DIY PiKVM for ATX Switch are provided in the [ATX Switch software environment install guide](./ATX_Switch_software_install_guide.pdf) (PDF).

*Note - the actual number of scripts to be installed, and the required configuration data, will be dependent upon the architecture of the installed environment.*
